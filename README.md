## Laravel Sandbox - Laravel v5.0.*

The purpose of this sandbox is to give an even quicker starting point in setting up a new Laravel application.
I have added several support services and example placeholders to help jump start development.
These are typical alterations that I make to each Laravel install before beginning a new project.

app\Repositories - a quick starting point for a repository patterned model directory with a few examples.

app\Services\Support - useful Support Services List
